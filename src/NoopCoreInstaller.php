/**
 * The plugin this class is part of has the only aim to download WordPress as a zip artifact,
 * without considering it a Composer package at all.
 *
 * This workflow is probably going to cause issues and conflicts if other packages require
 * WordPress as a Composer package.
 *
 * Since Composer does not have a public official API to remove packages "on the fly", the way we
 * could obtain that by using Composer script events are hackish and complicated.
 * The easiest solution I found is to replace the installer for 'wordpress-core' packages with
 * a custom installer (this class) that just does... nothing.
 * So Composer will think that WordPress package is installed and will not complain,
 * but nothing really happened.
